## Task
Write a simple App that displays the data hosted on https://api.myjson.com/bins/10pvr7 and display the entries in a list showing each characters *First Name*, *Last Name* and *Profileimage*.

You should host your project on a public Github repository and break your work down into logical smaller tasks that you can commit over time. 
(We don't want a single commit with all your code in it)

Test your logic (i.e. ViewModels), UI tests are not required.

## Libraries/Technologies we want you to use
* Android Databinding
* MVVM Architecture (Model-View-ViewModel)
* RxJava
* Retrofit
* Picasso
* Junit
